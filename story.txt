once upon a time there was a hare who took pride in his ability to run fast.
he then challenged a tortoise to a race.
the slow tortoise excepted the hare's challenge.
both of them got ready for the race.
all the animals nearby gathered to watch it too.
then finally the race started.
the hare ,taking advantage of his speed ran fast and got ahead.
the slow tortoise continued the race at his own speed.
the hare was now out of sight and far ahead.
"i am so ahead ...maybe i should take a nap there "thought the hare.
he went forward and slept in the shadow of a nearby tree.
the tortoise kept running the race.
after some time the tortoise finally caught up with the hare and saw him sleeping.
the hare kept on sleeping .
and after a long time the hare woke up from his nap and took a look around.
the tortoise was nowhere to be seen.
"he must still be behind "thought the hare and went back to sleep.
after that he finally woke up.
"maybe i should finish the race now it's been long enough."
the hare ran up to the finish line and was shocked to see the tortoise waiting there.
moral of the story :you should not be boastful of your own qualities.
